### Weapons
There are different primary weapons to choose from.
- Repeatedly press to shoot normally, and hold for an alternate fire that can charge up!
- (You don't have to break your fingers. So long as you are pressing at a reasonable pace, you are considered mashing, and the weapon will fire at max attack speed.)
    - Still, if you have finger problems, you can disable this in config
        - If you don't, give it a chance. it's p fun c:
