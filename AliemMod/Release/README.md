# Aliem
- ~~When will alien hominid invasion come out that shit's gonna be fun~~ it's out and it is fun indeed
- happy halloween modjam 2022 c:
- multiplayer compatible!
- overly configurable
- scepter support, emote support
- somewhat-ror-friendly version in config

Anything you'd like to say about the guy, ping me (`thetimesweeper`) on the ror2 modding discord or the enforcer discord (https://discord.gg/GgjjDvStcV).

## SotS fuckery. These issues are likely out of my control until gearbox fixes their issues

- sword projectileoverlap is no longer client authoritative. it might feel like ass on client. still works though
- charactermotor onhitground changes have made burrowing inconsistent

*someone get me some cool screenshots pls*

### Weapons
There are different primary weapons to choose from.
- Repeatedly press to shoot normally, and hold for an alternate fire that can charge up!
- (You don't have to break your fingers. So long as you are pressing at a reasonable pace, you are considered mashing, and the weapon will fire at max attack speed.)
    - Still, if you have finger problems, you can disable this in config
        - If you don't, give it a chance. it's p fun c:
