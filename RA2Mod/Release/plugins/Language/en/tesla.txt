Y/N\n>Y</line-height></style>\n\nВидеожурнал, 13 сентября 2055 г.\nСегодня я буду работать над полным бронежилетом Теслы, который я сделал для нашей секретной маленькой поездки, и немного поприветствую маленького Милослава, который думал, что писать своему старшему брату слишком утомительно. Кто бы подумал, что у него хватит духу раскрутить целую бутылку чистой водки, как какой - нибудь чемпион по скачкам!\n\n<style=cMono><line-height=15>=========================================\nTranslated Subtitles Enabled.\n=========================================</line-height></style>\n\nAnd then you had to join that phony, space-faring delivery company. Are you a delivery boy, Milo? I didn't think you'd stoop so low!\n\n[Audible Laughter]\n\nEver since we were but boys you always were the one with a broken mirror, who'd whistle indoors and walk under ladders. I remember the one time where we were running down the street, because our favourite ice cream shop opened that day, oh do I miss that double chocolate.. Anyway the shop just opened and when we were crossing the street? It was almost like every car in town wanted your head! Oh, and when we went ice skating for the first time! Many vivid memories! The lake back home surely wanted you to stay forever! If it weren't for me, the dashing hero that I am, saving you in the nick of time like any good and chivalrous older brother would.\n\n[Torch Lighter Sparks]\n\nEven now as adults, we are not free from the capitalism that took over home. In space, I thought we were free! But oho how mistaken I was. Its sad to see a poor comrade begging for coin every time you pass them by the ship docks, I always toss whatever is in my pocket to them, let it be cash or cigarettes. I bet you're feeling jealous, aren't you? Big bro taking away your cigarettes? Well it's because it's not healthy for you! I don't want my little bro shrivelling up like some babushka! We must be strong! For this universe is not kind to us... Certainly not you.\n\n[Engine Humming]\n\nSpeaking of strong things, I think the capacitor on my personal suit is calibrated, all it needs is a test drive. Oh if only you could see this Milo. If 20 volts can kill a horse then I'm able to take out a whole ranch! Just a single discharge gives a voltage of 200,000 watts! It even has a function to absorb kinetic energy and transform it into electricity, isn't that cool? You can't see it from this angle but I also have this deployable tower I can throw out in emergency that I have to be in two places at once, if i wasn't a staunch socialist I would be selling these like blini left and right. It's just that even when I work on my equipment, I can't get this thought of my head.\n\n[Metal Clang]\n\nYou know.. I really really do hope you're safe and okay.. We've always been in touch through thick and thin.. When I left home to pursue my engineering degree I always sent letters back home, sent ISM's when I hopped on the transport ship.. At least once a week I would find time to write down how I'd been, hoping you would do the same. You never missed a beat. UES is a shady company that always involved itself with cover ups and conspiracies about all sorts of things. I told you UES was dodgy yet you pushed and pushed that it's just another step in your career. Yet, when you stopped sending messages, I knew something was up.\n\n[Audible Sigh]\n\nI signed up to a commission job with an NDA for a undisclosed UES 'shipment'. The Safe Travels, It's called. Ironic coming from the UES. I've been assigned as a ship technician, they require commission expertise not just because of my talent, but the nature of the contract deems it secretive. I wouldn't think any of the conspiracies were true but aa-I-a suppose a broken clock is right twice a day-\n\n[Sirens]\n\nMiloslav, Miloslav,. I hope the next time this recording is played, it'll be with drinks and cheering and knowing that you're safe. I am not letting UES, or anything, harm you without their blood on my hands.\n\n[Distant Running]\n\nMiloslav, I will find you.\n\n<style=cMono><line-height=15>==========================================\n..... ... .\nPlay Again?\n>_</line-height></style>",
