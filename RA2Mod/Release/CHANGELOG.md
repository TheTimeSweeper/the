    - but jank that shouldn't fail anymore

`2.2.3`

`2.2.1`
- forgot to update text to the changes of last patch woops

`2.2.0`
- tesla trooper
  - passive: ally buff multiplier 1.3 -> 1.1
  - passive: ally buff shock duration 1 - 3.5
  - secondary (empowered): 1200% -> 1500%  
    - *He gets a lot of feedback that he's very strong, this may surprise you, because he also gets a lot of feedback that he's weak.*  
    - *I suspect a giant culprit is those people don't know to buff the tower before using secondary, missing out on a lot of his potential damage (1200% * 1.3 = 1560%)*  
    - *These changes remove this aspect from being a necessity, in exchange buffing a bit of its utility when you do decide to use it*  
    - *If you liked that aspect, configs will come at some point so you can revert these changes*
  - primary: animation plays on each bolt  
    - *as well as the tower aspect, I suspect the people are also missing out on tripling close-range primary damage. more feedback on doing multiple hits should help with this.*
  - Utility: sound now plays when absorbing damage, increasing in pitch based on damage absorbed  
    - *thanks rob for the suggestion. I agree with all your others as well so they'll come at some point*
    - *except except when you said it does a whole lot of nothing. late game it's a free 1800% with a giant aoe ya goon*
  - secondary (empowered): now commands Starstorm 2 Shock Drones as well
  - fix potential nullref spam on tracking component
- Desolator
  - ~~fixed a bug where sceptered special reverts to regular special after using it~~
    - ~~*I assume. I could not reproduce it so if it still happens to you, let me know and give a log*~~
