# Unit Ready

Adds 3 (+1.5 more in config) new survivors, Tesla Trooper, Desolator, and Chrono Legionnaire

Based on their respective units from Red Alert 2, but with SkeletorChampion coming in and saying "nah I'm model them to fit RoR2, and look awesome, and my dong is enormous".

## uh Tesla Trooper mod?
Now that there's more Red Alert characters I'm reuploading the mod under a new name. sorry bout any inconveniences. on the bright side this opens the door for all kinds of Red Alert content in the coming years maybe.  
Yes I have a lot of ideas but no I won't have time for them anytime soon. here's to hoping I suppose.

I Initially planned this release to include a lot more content and sprucing up for Tesla and Deso to celebrate, but welcome Seekers of the Storm update so here's the wip. have fun love ya
